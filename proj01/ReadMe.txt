Craig created makefile
Zach created header file

both of us worked on all the implementation together (drink.cpp)

The program works as expected

To run program:
Open up terminal cd into our proj01 directory and run the following command
"make"
this will output a 'proj01' executable
to run this executable simply type 
"./proj01"
(note: do not type the quatations when running commmands)
Then to clean up the .o files and executables run 
"make clean"

Thank You
