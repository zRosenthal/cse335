To compile please type ‘make’ into the console

To run please type ‘proj04 input.txt’ where input.txt is the input file to be used. (on some machine builds you may have to run using ‘./proj04 input.txt’)

When you are finished you may run the command ‘make clean’ to delete all system files.

Craig and Zachary equally contributed to this project.

All code was done in a pair as well as the uml. All planning and testing was also done together. 

We have submitted multiple input files for different test cases named accordingly.

Please only use these and if you need to, please edit these files rather than using/creating your own input file. There is an issue with windows adding a return character to the end of each line which will result in undefined behavior. 

Thanks! Happy grading :0
